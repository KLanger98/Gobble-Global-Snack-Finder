# Gobble-Global-Snack-Finder

## Description

The challenge for this assignment was to create our first fullstack application from the ground up as a group. Ultimately what we ended up creating is a website where users from around the world can post their favourite Snacks(whether that be chocolates, chips, drinks or lollies) for other users to discover and see. This way when another user intends to travel to a unique country or continent they will have an idea what unique snacks they have to try when they go to a supermarket in another country. Our motivation for creating this application was for users to easily access and gain knowlege of different snacks local to the country they are travelling too, this site allows them to veiw top rated snacks from a country, veiw and browse through different categories of snacks, making it easier for users experience various different foods in a new country. Through out this project we applied the knowlege gained from the  Adelaide University Web Development bootcamp. Throughout our project we employed the Javascript language and HTML language thorugh handlebars. We applied tailwind throughout our project to create a beautiful and user friendly experience. Additionally we inlcluded my SQL (with javascript) to create databases for the site and express to fur build your application.
